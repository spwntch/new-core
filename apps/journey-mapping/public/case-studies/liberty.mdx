streamlined customer journey is pivotal for businesses. It's not just about how

clear navigation, and drives desired actions. Graham Easton from Liberty shares

### **The Engagement**

Liberty, a name synonymous with financial services and investment solutions in
South Africa, realized the importance of delivering an impeccable online
experience for its users. Enter Interact RDT.

1. **Website UX Testing**: To truly understand what works and what doesn’t, it’s
   crucial to test a website's user experience. Interact RDT delved deep into
   Liberty's website, pinpointing areas of enhancement, recommending strategic
   improvements, and ensuring that the site was not only user-friendly but also
   drove business objectives.

2. **Customer Journey Mapping**: The customer journey is a pivotal element of a
   business's interaction with its users. Mapping this journey ensures that
   every touchpoint is optimized for user satisfaction and conversion. With
   Interact RDT's expertise, Liberty was able to identify, streamline, and
   enhance key touchpoints, ensuring a smoother, more intuitive journey for
   their customers.

### **A Partnership Paradigm**

What stood out for Graham was the sense of partnership that developed during the
engagement. Instead of a client-supplier dynamic, it was a collaborative effort,
with clear business objectives guiding the research and testing. This resulted
in actionable insights that weren’t just theoretical but practically
implementable into the business framework.

Reflecting on the collaboration, Graham Easton remarked, "My experience with
Interact has been specific around website UX testing and Customer Journey
Mapping. In both these instances they have been professional, insightful, and
above all else always been realistic in what will work for the business. We
developed a true partnership approach... I therefore highly recommend them for
this detailed and methodical approach."
