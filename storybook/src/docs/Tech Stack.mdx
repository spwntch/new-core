# Our Tech Stack

In our pursuit of excellence and efficiency in development workflows, we've adopted an NX monorepo design. This approach not only fosters consistency and collaboration across our codebase but also optimizes our development processes to better serve our clients. The integration of various technologies and tools plays a pivotal role in achieving these objectives. Below is an overview of the key components of our tech stack and how they contribute to our project's success.

## Development Workflow Automation and CI/CD

### NX Monorepo & GitHub Actions

Our core development strategy revolves around the NX monorepo framework, enhancing our team's ability to work in a unified codebase environment. Coupled with GitHub Actions, we automate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This automation ensures that our code is consistently tested, integration-ready, and deployed with efficiency, thereby elevating productivity and code quality.

## Frontend Development

### Next.js

Chosen for its powerful server-side rendering capabilities, Next.js enables us to deliver web pages with faster load times, improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and a more dynamic user experience. This strategic choice underscores our commitment to building highly performant and SEO-friendly web applications.

### Tailwind CSS

Embracing a utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS empowers our design team to create custom, responsive designs with high fidelity. This approach streamlines the development of visually appealing and consistent interfaces.

### Radix UI

Our component library of choice, Radix UI, guarantees accessibility and extensive customization options. It lays the groundwork for creating user interfaces that are not only inclusive but also highly adaptable to various user needs.

## Design System and Component Isolation

### Storybook & Vite.js

To ensure our design system remains robust and coherent, we utilize Storybook in conjunction with Vite.js. This combination facilitates a quicker development cycle by isolating, testing, and documenting components in real-time, thereby enhancing the quality and consistency of our UI components.

## Content Management and Schema Validation

### MDX with unified.js

For content management, we leverage MDX and unified.js, enabling our non-technical team members to easily publish and manage content. This ensures a seamless flow of updates and maintains uninterrupted content delivery.

### Zod

Zod is employed for schema validation within our applications, ensuring data integrity and providing a type-safe development environment. This significantly reduces the occurrence of bugs and improves the overall developer experience.

## Backend Integration and Hosting

### Supabase & Vercel

For backend services, we rely on Supabase for its comprehensive backend-as-a-service offerings. Vercel is our choice for hosting, praised for its global edge network and exceptional support for Next.js projects, ensuring our applications are fast, reliable, and scalable.

This documentation is designed to provide a clear overview of our technology stack and the rationale behind our choices, ensuring that stakeholders and new team members alike can understand and appreciate the foundations of our development practices.
